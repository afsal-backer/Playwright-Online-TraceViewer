# Access Playwright Trace Viewer & Reports Online via Amazon S3

Running Playwright tests on a CI platform is a great way to ensure the reliability of your web application. However, managing the generated test reports and trace files can be a bit cumbersome. Traditionally, team members have to download these artifacts and analyse them locally, which could be time-consuming and inefficient. Additionally, sharing the findings with the team posed its own set of challenges.

This project shows how to set up Playwright tests on GitHub Actions to generate test reports and trace files  for convenient one-click online access by storing them on Amazon S3 , providing a more efficient way to analyze and share the results with the team.
